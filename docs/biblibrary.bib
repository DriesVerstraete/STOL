abstract = {Thin haul transportation refers to the air transportation of passengers on very small capacity aircraft over ultra-short distances. This envisioned form of transportation has the potential to fundamentally change the way people commute and travel. Yet, thin haul air transportation has never experienced the kind of success that was envisioned owing to operating hurdles and very high operating costs. The past decade has nevertheless seen tremendous developments in the fields of aircraft manufacturing, electric propulsion, and flight deck technologies enabling simplified vehicle operations. This convergence of technologies may prove to be a catalyst for thriving thin haul air transportation provided that aircraft manufacturers and operators can fully exploit the potential for efficiency gains. In this research, the economics of electric thin haul air transportation are reviewed to ensure that the promises for lower energy expenditures and for higher asset utilization are met. In particular, a strategy to both recharge and swap batteries at airports without impacting the schedule of commuter operators is proposed. This ensures that energy costs can be reduced by at least 70{\%} compared to current state of the art commuter aircraft.},

abstract = {With high incomes, long commutes, severe ground geographic constraints, severe highway congestion during peak commute times, high housing costs, and near perfect year-round weather, the Silicon Valley is positioned to be an excellent early adopter market for emerging aviation On-Demand Mobility transportation solutions. Prior efforts have attempted to use existing aviation platforms (helicopters or General Aviation aircraft) with existing infrastructure solutions, or only investigated new vehicle platforms without understanding how to incorporate new vehicle types into existing built-up communities. Research has been performed with the objective of minimizing door-to-door time for " Hyper Commuters " (frequent, long-distance commuters) in the Silicon Valley through the development of new helipad infrastructure for ultra-low noise Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. Current travel times for chosen city-pairs across urban and suburban commutes are compared to future mobility concepts that provide significantly higher utilization and productivity to yield competitive operating costs compared to existing transportation choices. Helipads are introduced near current modes of transportation and infrastructure for ease-of-access, and maximizing proximity. Strategies for both private and public infrastructure development are presented that require no new land purchase while minimizing community noise exposure. New VTOL concepts are introduced with cruise speeds of 200 mph, which yield a greater than three times improvement in overall door-to-door time when compared to current automobiles, and in some cases, improvements of up to 6 times lower trip times.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes both the vision and the early public-private collaborative research for the small air-craft transportation system (SATS). The paper outlines an operational definition of SATS, describes how SATS conceptually differs from current air transportation capabilities, introduces four SATS operating capabilities, and explains the relation between the SATS operating capabilities and the potential for expanded air mobility. The SATS technology roadmap encompasses on-demand, widely distributed, point-to-point air mobility, through hired-pilot modes in the nearer term, and through self-operated user modes in the farther term. The nearer-term concept is based on aircraft and airspace technologies being developed to make the use of smaller, more widely distributed community reliever and general aviation airports and their runways more useful in more weather conditions, in commercial hired-pilot service modes. The farther-term vision is based on technical concepts that could be devel-oped to simplify or automate many of the operational functions in the aircraft and the airspace for meeting future public transportation needs in personally operated modes. NASA technology strategies form a roadmap between the nearer-term concept and the farther-term vision. This paper outlines a roadmap for scalable, on-demand, distributed air mobility technologies for vehicle and airspace systems. The audiences for the paper include general aviation manufacturers; small aircraft transportation service providers; the flight training industry; airport and transportation authorities at the federal, state, and local levels; and organizations involved in planning for future national airspace system advancements.},

abstract = {Future, on-demand, electrically-powered " Sky Taxi " aircraft must be able to deliver both people and packages at high proximity " pocket airparks " that minimize the length of 'last mile' surface travel for the short-range trips that people most often make. These are sub-100 mile trips that stay within metropolitan 'mega-regions'. Such a regional " Sky Transit " system would serve a vastly larger user base than that for trips that exceed 160 km (100 miles) in length. Sky Transit would necessarily operate with a very different type of aircraft than the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) type used on longer range, higher speed general aviation (GA) flights. Ultra-quiet, V/ESTOL Sky Taxis, by having a much higher duty cycle than GA, would also be much more affordable. Fortunately, electrically-powered aircraft whose range is somewhat limited by present day battery technology could still fulfill the Sky Transit mission requirements if designed for robotic battery swap. A prospective business model for such regional Sky Transit using various cost scenarios and market penetrations shows its potential for strong profitability as well as numerous societal benefits. The San Francisco metropolitan region is analyzed with respect to its inter-county and major corridor surface traffic volumes in order to project realistic ridership for a fully implemented regional Sky Transit system. The analysis includes actual trip distances that account for direct flight path versus tortuous surface road path lengths. The subjective aspect of 'crowding of the skies' is examined by projections of a sky image simulated during peak operations. Partitioning of the region's airspace by assignment of altitudes is used as a means to estimate such projections and the attendant separation distances. Fast tempo take-off and landing operations are examined for their effect upon profitability and system capacity. Peak capacity at locations with the greatest number of daily travelers is examined in terms of operational intervals and safe aircraft separations. The relationship between land parcel size and availability with high proximity for the most popular traveler destinations is examined as a means to define the limiting case of short runway operations. Trip fares and their effect upon ridership and profitability are explored relative to alternative modes of surface travel and on a cost per km basis. The total regional electrical energy demand that would attend a full-fledged, electrically-powered Sky Transit system is estimated. The effect of Sky Transit in easing surface gridlock is estimated, along with its effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

abstract = {The trend toward rapid urbanization into megacities and the enormous costs for transportation infrastructure that this entails are expected to continue for decades. The strong and consistent preference of individuals for distributed travel in private vehicles rather than for route-limited travel in crowded public transit also has shown no signs of diminishing. These trends have a significant adverse effect on climate change. Regional Sky Transit 1,2 (RST) has been proposed as a system that can drastically reduce infrastructure cost and CO2 emissions while preserving people's preference for travel in personal vehicles by providing affordable, accessible, fast, and safe flights distributed across urban regions. RST could thus provide a substantial, new, efficient, value-added supply chain. As such, RST could become aviation's largest market in terms of number of flights, significantly contributing to the growth of connectivity and productivity across population centers. The RST mass market could serve travelers on relatively short trip lengths of less than 160 kilometers. This civil mass market derives from the concept of high proximity aviation— extending air travel operations to numerous very small airparks that are close to where people live and work, so as to reduce ground travel time and thereby save time. This can only be achieved if the aircraft used in RST fulfill stringent limitations on allowable noise emissions that will be essential to high proximity aviation. Examination of the extensive prior research on allowable noise emissions shows that noise issues will dictate both the size of airparks and the concept of operations for RST. This paper reveals why this primacy of noise must be respected, and presents detailed examples of the profound constraints it imposes upon V/ESTOL aircraft designs intended to serve the RST mass market. The barriers to developing the ultra-quiet aircraft necessary to RST along with the most promising strategies for efficiently overcoming those barriers are presented. These strategies include models for how electric propulsion and its energy requirements can best be integrated into Sky Taxis that are suitable for the mission requirements of RST. Those integrations will examine the core science and technologies that affect propulsive noise emission and reveal opportunities for further competitive research. The value and benefits of RST will be compared with the costs of bringing about the necessary noise reduction breakthroughs.

abstract = {The thin-haul commuter concept refers to an envisioned class of four to nine passenger aircraft operating very short flights and providing scheduled and on-demand air services from smaller airports. Its objective is to enhance regional mobility reach by combining the flexibility of automobile travel with the shorter commute times associated with air travel. To achieve economic viability, the thin-haul commuter concept must provide appreciable economic advantages when compared to current commuter aircraft. This may be achieved by increasing the revenue potential through innovative pricing and scheduling, while dras-tically reducing operating costs, in particular, energy, maintenance, and labor costs. These ambitious objectives require the infusion of new cutting edge technologies. The use of distributed electric propulsion is investigated to reduce both energy and maintenance ex-penditures. New avionics systems are considered to enable simplified operations and thus to reduce both labor and training costs. The purpose of this on-going research is to assess the viability of the thin-haul aviation concept by investigating both the operational and economic impact of introducing a fleet of distributed electric propulsion aircraft into the operations of a commuter airline. This paper presents the development of an integrated economics and operations model that incorporates preliminary estimates of a distributed electric propulsion vehicle performance as well as some aspects of typical commuter opera-tor schedules. The model helps compare advanced electric vehicles with more conventional commuters, and therefore enables a preliminary assessment of the expected cost savings.},

abstract = {By providing affordable, accessible, fast, and safe flights distributed across urban/suburban mega-regions using electrically-powered small aircraft (Sky Taxis), Regional Sky Transit 1,2,3 (RST) aims to reduce CO2 emissions and the cost of surface infrastructure while preserving people's strong preference for on-demand travel in personal vehicles. In its fullest expression, RST could become aviation's largest market in terms of number of flights because it could serve a large share of the billions of daily trips of less than 160 kilometers. As such, RST promises to be both economically and environmentally sustainable. That fullest expression of RST would require an extensive network of community-acceptable, high-proximity " pocket airparks " in order to minimize ground travel time (GTT). These airparks would face fundamental design constraints that would depend upon whether they were located in a downtown, high-rise urban area or a suburban residential area, and both these areas would need to be served in order to maximize market size and profitability. High proximity would require that airparks be as small as practicable while still providing the efficiency of a high duty cycle of shared use as a form of public transit. Pocket airparks would need to fulfill community noise constraints and have sufficient area to enable a high capacity of passenger throughput. Airparks would need to comply with pertinent building codes and meet the regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They would need to fulfill applicable present and future FAA regulations and standards, including the integration of their traffic into the ATM system. Provisions for near-all weather operations, electrical charging stations, on-site solar panel arrays, service bays, transit connections, security, lighting, perimeter fencing, etc., would all be needed. Uniform, realistic standards for airpark size and acceptable noise limits will be fundamental to successfully implementing pocket airparks close by to where people live. From these and other requirements it is possible to distill the range of reasonable and definable design limits for both the airpark and the small Sky Taxis that will serve RST. This paper explores those requirements, compares them to what might pertain at alternative types of take off and landing sites and presents a rational plan for the implementation and operation of an RST system.
